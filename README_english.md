# Hi there, it's Pedro here! 👋
## Today I came to show a little bit of my knowledge in Python.
A few days ago I finished my 'Introduction to Computer Science with Python Part 1' course from USP. 🚀

This course was taught by Professor Fabio Kon, who has a great teaching style, and with him I learned everything from how to install python on my PC to conditionals, variables, while and for loops, functions and list manipulation in python.
In addition, Fabio explained about good practices in python, the importance of performing automated tests and also how to use the debugger.

### Final Project
This project brings together all the content seen during the course. It consisted of a plagiarism detection program, where authors who wrote plagiarized texts are infected with a disease called COH-PIAH.
Some ready-made functions were provided based on the 're' library that facilitated the development of the project. Through the signatures of each author it was possible to detect who each text is, and based on a standard signature of infected people it was possible to detect which of the authors were infected.

ℹ️ Signatures consist of linguistic features such as average word size, Type-Token ratio, Hapax Legomana ratio, average sentence size, sentence complexity, average phrase size.

#### My goal was to create 3 functions:
- compara_assinatura(as_a, as_b):
> This function compares the standard signature (of an infected person) with the signatures of other texts.

- calcula_assinatura(texto):
> This function calculates the signatures of the given texts, texts will be given in the 'input' where they will be converted into signatures, a list with the linguistic features of that text and will subsequently be compared with the function compara_assinatura(as_a, as_b)

- avalia_textos(textos, ass_cp):
> This function will evaluate the texts given in the 'input', so it will "call" the other two functions that I created to be able to evaluate the given texts with the standard signature.

## Thank you for your attention 😊
If you made it this far, THANK YOU SO MUCH, your time is very important and I appreciate you spending it seeing one of my projects.

I'm just starting a journey to be a Data Scientist, and Python will be very important for this goal of mine, follow me for more content and projects from a Data Science student.

Bye.
